The penguin waddled across the deserted beach, its black and white feathers glistening in the sunlight. It was a strange sight to see a penguin so far from its natural habitat, but it seemed to be enjoying the warm weather. The penguin stopped at the edge of the water and looked out at the ocean, as if contemplating a swim. Suddenly, a wave crashed onto the shore, and the penguin was soaked from head to toe. It shook itself off and waddled back up the beach, disappearing into the dunes.
